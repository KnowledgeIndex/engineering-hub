# What Is Technical Debt?

“Technical Debt” is **an emergent condition** present in any digitally-enabled business enterprise that has now discovered its **technology** is **too rigid to accommodate new business objectives** that have come to light. It is too rigid because of past system design and architecture decisions that were made, *usually with the best intentions*, based on the engineer’s knowledge of business objectives that were available at the time.

Good engineers try as a professional point of pride to keep as many options  open as they can in the technology for as long as possible. They know  that requirements will change, and they try mightily to preserve  flexibility, if for no other reason than to save their own sanity when  inevitably requirements change. And change they always do.

But eventually, the system must be optimized for a particular set of  business objectives and at the expense of others. In other words, we  future-proof, to the best of our ability, but we ain’t got a crystal  ball.

# Why Is Technical Debt Important?

The only reason to build technology at all is to automate a manual process  for some human purpose. While we could include non-profit and public  sector examples here, the vast majority of technology is built for  profit-seeking businesses. So those processes have a business purpose.

Automating a business process requires knowing everything about the business that  is relevant to that particular process. But businesses change. Customers want different things. Competitors come along with new capabilities  that we have to copy them in order to keep up (maybe). Partnerships and  mergers arise where we need to replace one system with another slightly  different system that does more or less the same thing. All of this  variation puts pressure on the original design of the system that is  automating the business process in question.

Software can be made to be quite flexible to change. But that flexibility comes  at a cost. It takes time and care to make a flexible system, and that  time is in direct conflict with the pressures from the business to meet  customer needs ASAP.
